# patchloop
Design files for the PatchLoop PCB

The files patchloop2.kicad_* contain the version with RJ45 jacks on opposite sides. This allows for neat short traces between the jacks.

I needed to rework the files patchloop.kicad_* (jacks on same side) because the first version contained a bug so that only one loop was used effectively.
