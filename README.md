# patchloop

This is a fork of the patchloop PCB from https://github.com/hennichodernich/ (DC4HP).

With this PCB you can build a broadband(?) 8 turn magloop antenna with just an UTP Ethernet cable.

Changes in my R2 vs the base design:

* Using the s0-kicad-lib
* Using a low-cost SMD RS45 jack
* Placed all components on the same side for easy reflow / vapor phase soldering of most components
